Customize the CSS class names within the HTML that is output from the WordPress gallery shortcode

== Description ==

Add another shortcode "gallery-wrap" that allows you to "inject" class names into the HTML that is generated by the built-in gallery shortcode.

Simply wrap your existing gallery shortcodes with this new "gallery-wrap" shortcode:

`[gallery-wrap class="cool-gallery" img_class="cool-img" a_class="cool-anchor" data-foo="bar"]
 	[gallery link="file" ids="8,9,10,11,5"]
 [/gallery-wrap]'

The above example will result in the following:

* Appends a class name of "cool-gallery" to the surrounding gallery div element.
* Appends a class name of "cool-img" onto each image tag within the gallery.
* Adds a class name of "cool-anchor" onto each anchor tag within the gallery.
* Adds the attribute "data-foo='bar'" onto the surrounding gallery div element.

Any extra attributes added to the shortcode will be appended onto the surrounding div element. This is helpful for adding data attributes or anything you like really.
